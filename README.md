## Overview

This is version 1 of my personal portfolio project, showcasing my initial learning of HTML, CSS and Javascript alongside a few projects using these skills. I plan to add more projects as I work on them and more Javascript to the website itself as I progress in my front-end developer journey.

### Built With

This website is built with HTML, CSS and a little Javascript.
