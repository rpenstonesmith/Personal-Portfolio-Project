## Overview

This is version 1 of my personal portfolio project, showcasing my initial learning of HTML and CSS alongside a couple of projects using these skills too alongside a little javascript. I plan to add more projects as I work on them and more Javascript to the website itself as I progress in my front-end developer journey.

<!-- TODO: Add a screenshot of the live project.
    1. Link to a 'live demo.'
    2. Describe your overall experience in a couple of sentences.
    3. List a few specific technical things that you learned or improved on.
    4. Share any other tips or guidance for others attempting this or something similar.
 -->

### Built With

This website is built with HTML and CSS. Javascript coming soon!
